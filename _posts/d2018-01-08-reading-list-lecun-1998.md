This is the first post where I recap important papers as part of continuing my data science education. 

This 1998 Yann LeCun paper discusses solutions to high-dimensional pattern recognition, ie handwritten character or speech. 

It shows that *hand-crafted* individually designed feature extraction modules can be replaced by *automatic learning machines* that operate directly on pixel images.

It thus suggests a new paradigm called Graph Transformer Networks that optimizes on global performance. 

and associated training techniques.
