WHAT ARE KEY METRICS that drive the company?

# 1. How does the company make money? - How can I help the company make more money?

The revenue is realized from daily sales, for about 4 months a year, with July the best performing month throughout the year. 

The average lifetime value of a customer is %15, while max is 2700 and min is 0.07. 

Average spending per customer (credit card?): almost 70% of cards don't have an ID, but those who do, is $11

As there are more options, the LTV (+churn prediction, forecasting, customer LTV modeling) is decreasing

- how much are expenses, inventory, staffing, accounting 

# CLV
Customer Lifetime Value, or “CLV”, is one of the most important, yet difficult metrics for restaurant owners to track, understand, and utilize. Why? Restaurant customer lifetime value depends on predicting customer behavior and hinges on a variety of factors restaurant owners should seek to improve. **Repeat loyal customers generate 10x more revenue in their lifetime than new customers.** 

Monthly Customer Churn Rate
The most basic churn rate equation is number of churned customers divided by total number of customers (in a given period). Because we can’t know for sure how every customer will behave, calculating customer churn is not an exact science. After all, one customer could come back six days after their visit, while others return for their second time after six years.

Tricky thing is, because restaurants are not gyms and don’t require their customers to sign 12-month contracts, CLV does require some predictive work for a restaurant. driven by a series of approximations – average ticket size, party size, order frequency, etc. – all rolled into one final number.

### Calculating the Customer Lifetime Value

CLV tells you what the monetary return will be on the average guest in your restaurant. If you’re investing all this money in marketing to and bringing in new business, you should know what exactly you’re getting in exchange for your efforts.
Before you do the calculation, you will need to gather some data from the previous year’s sales. Make sure it’s a full year’s worth of data you’re working with.

The formula for customer lifetime value requires a few steps:

1. Total Revenue ÷ Total Number of Orders (over 365 days) = Average Order Value (AOV)
2. Total Number of Orders ÷ Total Number of Unique* Customers (over 365 days) = Purchase Frequency (f)
3. AOV * f = Customer Value (CV)

This is your average customer value for the year. To calculate how much they’re worth over their lifetime:

4. Average Lifespan of Customer (in years) * CV = Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

This is your average customer lifetime value.


# 2. Who is the customer? 

There are 143 returning customers throughout the years, or 1%.

How can we help the company attract more customers, or convert more existing customers into high-value customers?
The target market is 
If I had consumers' demographics data, I could see what sections, say geographic regions, to target and what sections of the market are missing. 
The distribution of paying customers? What differentiates the power user from the rest of your customers? 

# How does the product work? -How can I help make the product better?
Where people drop off? At what percentage rates?
Learn your customer retention like the back of your hand. Do people drop out after a couple hours, a couple days, a couple months, a couple years? You’re learning whether your product is a fruit fly (short lifecycle) or an elephant (long lifecycle). There’s nothing inherently wrong with either of these, so long as it suits your business model.

# 3. How does the company lose money? - How can I help the company lose less money?
Learn the industry standards for customer retention, acquisition rates, upgrade rates, return rates, and other metrics to understand whether your company is doing well or poorly at these things. 

leaky points in every business:  customers drop out in the acquisition funnel, customers “churn” (don’t retain), or stick on the non-premium version of the product. What is your customer retention? Where do customers tend to fall off? What does that say about the value of the product? What differentiates users who churn from your devoted users?
